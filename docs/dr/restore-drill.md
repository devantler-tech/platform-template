# DR restore drill (CI)

`.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs a `restore-drill` job on every PR that
touches `k8s/**` or the cluster configs. The job validates the full
backup → data-loss → restore cycle end-to-end on a local Talos+Docker
cluster, so the Velero code path is regression-tested **before** changes
reach `prod`.

## What it does

1. `ksail cluster create` and reconcile all workloads.
2. Wait for **Velero** + **MinIO** (the local R2 stand-in) to be ready
   and `BackupStorageLocation/default` `Available`.
3. Create a marker `Namespace`/`ConfigMap` carrying the GitHub
   `run-id` and `sha` (so identity can be proved later).
4. `velero backup create` against the marker namespace, `--wait` for
   `Completed`.
5. **Simulate data loss**: delete the marker namespace (`kubectl delete
   namespace`).
6. Assert the marker namespace does **not** exist after deletion.
7. `velero restore create --from-backup ... --wait` for `Completed`.
8. Assert the marker `ConfigMap` is back and `data.run-id` matches the
   current `GITHUB_RUN_ID`.
9. Tear down the cluster (`if: always()`).

> **Why namespace deletion instead of full cluster rebuild?** MinIO runs
> in-cluster with ephemeral storage, so destroying the cluster would also
> destroy the backup target. Namespace deletion simulates data loss while
> keeping MinIO (and thus the backup data) intact, exercising the same
> Velero → S3 → Velero code path end-to-end.

## Wall-clock budget

`timeout-minutes: 240` on the job — matches the **4 h RTO** documented
in [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md). In practice the drill runs in ~15 min.
The 4 h ceiling is the operator promise for the manual prod path; CI
keeps that promise honest by failing fast if the local round trip
explodes.

## What this catches

- A regression in the Velero install (chart version bump, RBAC drift,
  missing AWS plugin).
- A regression in the MinIO install or its credential wiring (Velero
  `BackupStorageLocation` going `Unavailable`).
- Backup format incompatibility introduced by a Velero version bump.
- A reconciliation regression that makes `velero` or `minio` never
  become Ready inside the 10-minute rollout window.

## What this does **not** catch

- Cloudflare R2 specifics (CRC checksum quirk, bucket policy, IAM key
  rotation). That's `prod`-only and needs a periodic manual drill
  documented in [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md#scenario-3-restore-an-app-namespace-from-velero).
- Omni etcd backup/restore — no longer part of the platform; etcd is a
  cattle resource recreated by `ksail cluster create`. Full-cluster
  recovery is covered by [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md#scenario-4-full-cluster-rebuild-from-zero).
- CNPG PITR — covered by the CNPG operator's own e2e; we only verify
  that the `ScheduledBackup` reconciles. A future extension could write
  a row, backup, delete, restore, and read the row back.
- Full cluster rebuild with R2 — in prod the backup survives cluster
  destruction (it lives in R2). That scenario is covered by the manual
  procedure in the runbook.

## Why no etcd encryption verification step

Talos `cluster.secretboxEncryptionSecret` is verified at install time by
Talos itself (it refuses to bootstrap with a malformed key). A separate
"read raw etcd, grep for plaintext" step adds CI complexity for a
property that is structurally enforced. If a future regression suggests
the encryption is silently disabled, add a `talosctl etcd snapshot` +
`etcdctl get --print-value-only ... | grep -aq SECRET && exit 1` step.

## Local manual run

```bash
ksail cluster create
ksail workload push && ksail workload reconcile

# Create marker
kubectl create ns dr-drill
kubectl -n dr-drill create configmap dr-marker --from-literal=t=$(date -u +%FT%TZ)

# Backup
velero backup create dr-drill --include-namespaces dr-drill --wait

# Simulate data loss
kubectl delete namespace dr-drill --wait=true --timeout=2m
until ! kubectl get namespace dr-drill >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done

# Restore
velero restore create dr-drill-restore --from-backup dr-drill --wait
kubectl -n dr-drill get configmap dr-marker -o yaml
```
